        <h2>Malvanua Island beach house</h2>

        <p>Malvanua is a small private island just off the beautiful East Coast of Santo, Vanuatu. It offers one well-appointed and self contained beach house for short term holiday rentals on a self catering basis. The owners live on the opposite side of the 25 acre island so it feels like you have the place to yourselves.
           The house has two double bedrooms opening onto the beach, each with en-suite shower room. There is a central living/dining area with a fully fitted kitchen and a large covered deck, all just metres from the sea. It is ideal for a family of four or for two couples,
           for honeymooners looking for the ultimate secluded getaway or anyone looking for a peaceful retreat in picture-postcard tropical surroundings with the sea on the doorstep.
           Swimming in clear, blue water is a few steps from the deck. Turtles cruise by on a regular basis and dugongs are occasional visitors to the bay. There is spectacular snorkelling on the other side of the island, in fantastic coral gardens. Or just lie in your hammock and watch the fish jumping in the bay in front of the house.</p>

        <h2>Things TO DO</h2>

        <P>Malvanua Island is the ultimate getaway if you are looking for peace and tranquility and the chance to enjoy the unspoiled beauty of a small island in the tropics, all to yourselves. Transport to and from the airport is included in your stay and additional trips to town can be arranged. But if you are looking for the hustle and bustle of town, daily shopping trips and nights out, then this isn't the place for you.
           Kayaks are available at no charge and allow you to explore the bay, paddle up the river to the Matevulu Blue Hole or out to nearby Turtle Island. And if you don't feel like cooking there is a friendly resort within easy kayaking distance
           which offers breakfast, lunch and dinner for non-residents. It's a five minute boat ride to the mainland, from where we can arrange for transport to town (approx 25 minutes) or to a range of other activities.
           f you prefer to drive yourselves, car hire is now available locally on a daily basis. Fishing trips, diving, horse riding and golf can also be arranged.</

        <h2>Accommodation and Facilities</h2>

        <p>The beauty of staying on Malvanua Island is in getting away from it all, so if you want to maximise your time on the island we can arrange to do your food shopping for you,
           so that you arrive to a well stocked fridge and freezer. And plenty of time to enjoy your own island paradise. 
           The large covered deck has an outside dining table and a couple of hammocks.
           An extra bed can be made available in the living room on request, so the house can sleep up to five</p>
